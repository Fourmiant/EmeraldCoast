* Play Information *
Game                    : DOOM2

Single Player           : Yes
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Yes 
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Yes, but not tested. Many levels are altered in-game to make them more hospitable to DM play.

Difficulty Settings     : Yes, so I don't want to hear any whining about it being too difficult.

 
* Construction *
Base                    : New levels from scratch
Build Time              : No idea, way way too long anyway. I started this in late 2018.

Known Bugs              : Texture alignment bugs. Probably other bugs too.

May Not Run With...     : Doom2.exe. Don't even try it. The new version is however compatible with pure limit removing ports.

Lame story (tm):
You travel through dimensions and kill monsters, blah blah... Use your imagination.
