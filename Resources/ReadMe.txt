Description             : This is my first wad and my first shot at doom
                          mapping. The goal is to attempt to recreate an
                          experience close to vanilla doom mappacks. Keyword
                          here, close.

                          Best experienced with both crouch and jump disabled.

Map #                   : Map01-32
Single Player           : Yes
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Yes
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Yes, but not tested. Many levels are altered in-game
                          to make them more hospitable to DM play.

Difficulty Settings     : Yes, so I don't want to hear any whining about it
                          being too difficult (or too easy o.O).

 
* Construction *
Base                    : New levels from scratch

                          late 2018.

Known Bugs              : Texture alignment bugs. Probably other bugs too.

May Not Run With...     : Doom2.exe. Don't even try it. This requires a Zdoom
                          UDMF and ACS Scripts limiting removing port.

Lame story (tm):
You travel through dimensions and kill monsters, blah blah...
Use your imagination.
