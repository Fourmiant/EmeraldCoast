Description             : This is my first wad and my first shot at doom mapping.
                          The goal is to attempt to recreate an experience close to
                          vanilla doom mappacks. Keyword here, close.

                          Best experienced with both crouch and jump disabled.
                          Freelook is allowed, and autoaim is not mandatory.
